                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far I learned a lot as Developer during last year. Have a bit of experience working as team member, as well by myself.
                    Speaking about professional skills - I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript. 
                    Familiar with Node.js and most popular back-end frameworks such as Express.js, Koa.js, Nest.js.
                    Done a couple basic CRUD APIs with each of them. Tested with Postman. Worked with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases.
                    Familiar with React, Firebase. Trying to improve usage of Redux and Hooks, TypeScript.
                    Of course my knowledge is basic and need a lot of improvements, and I know it's not an easy path. But I seeing myself as
                    future full-stack developer.
