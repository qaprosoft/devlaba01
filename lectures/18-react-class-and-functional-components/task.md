(You have to sign up to see the styles. Let me know if you have any issues.)

Avatar app: where possible to add more tiles with random avatars or refresh all tiles. Use https://tinyfac.es/. Design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Qdx7H8mHFh87ExCVXE470S/Tile-Project?node-id=0%3A1). Assets are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1UywgqalcaJKoix3U8Jt4ugembn2L0gps).

AC:
- As a user I would like to be able to add the tile with random avatar
- As a user I would like to be able to refresh the avatar
- As a user I would like to be able to refresh all avatars


Good Luck!
