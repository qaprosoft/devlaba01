# HTML & CSS 3 practice

## Update CV... Again... ;)

We need to adjust our CV using transitions/animations and increase layout performance.

### Definition of done

* All elements requiring property changes should be animated (only `:hover`/`:focus` states)
* All style definitions should use media requests
* If you use the `hamburger menu` you need to make a transition from 3-line icon to a cross (e.g. on `hover`)
* Count of layers that you use should be optimized. If you use a new layer you need to understand why you're using it
* **Advanced**: Create a fake "portfolio" on the page and make an interesting animation on hover. You can make your solution up or try to implement an animation from examples:
  * [Example 1](https://tympanus.net/Development/GridLoadingAnimations/) (try to hover on full story)
  * [Example 2](https://tympanus.net/Tutorials/OriginalHoverEffects/) – here’s a lot of different animations
