Your task is to prove that `Math.random` is working (or isnâ€™t working) according to [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
Generate a random number in range from 0 to 100 each N milliseconds (depends on the value which is selected in time range input) and recalculate chart bars accordingly. Two highest bars should have different color in compare to the others. User should be able to start and stop number generation and to reset the whole chart. When number generating is active the time range input should be disabled.
You can use basic `<input type="range" ... />` element without any styling to save time. The range should start from .1s to 1s with .1s step.

Good Luck!
